# Gradianto Deep Ocean

## Colour Theme for VSCode meant to loosely replicate the popular JetBrains IDE theme

I've updated the first release due to colour shennanigans in my IDE, but kept the Old Version so anyone who doesn't want to differentiate between keywords, variables and classes may continue to do so.
